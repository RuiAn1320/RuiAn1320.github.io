- name: Reconstructing the early-universe expansion and thermal history
  arxiv: 2310.17195
  desc: We present a model-independent reconstruction of the early expansion and thermal histories of the universe, obtained from light element abundance measurements. The expansion history is tightly constrained around the onset of the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). The temperature of photons is additionally constrained around the time of neutrino decoupling. Allowing for perturbations to the standard expansion rate, we find that the radiation energy density is constrained to within 15% of its LCDM value, and only 1% extra matter energy density is allowed around the epoch of BBN. We introduce a new and general analytic fitting formula for the temperature variation, which is flexible enough to reproduce the signal of large classes of beyond-CDM particle models that can alter the temperature through early-time energy injection. We present its constraints from BBN data and from the measurements of effective number of relativistic species and helium-4 abundance probed by the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation anisotropy. Our results provide clarity on the most fundamental properties of the early universe, reconstructed with minimal assumptions about the unknown physics that can occur at keV--MeV energy scales and can be mapped to broad classes of models of interest to cosmology.

- name: Can Neutrino Self-interactions Save Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter?
  arxiv: 2301.08299
  desc: Sterile neutrinos produced through self-interactions of active neutrinos have received attention as a particle candidate that can yield the entire observed DM relic abundance without violating the most stringent constraints from X-ray observations. We examine consistency of this production mechanism with the abundance of small-scale structure in the universe, as captured by the population of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way.

- name: What does cosmology tell us about the mass of thermal-relic dark matter?
  arxiv: 2202.03515
  desc: The presence of light thermally coupled dark matter affects early expansion history and production of light elements during the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Specifically, dark matter that annihilates into Standard Model particles can modify the effective number of light species in the universe Neff, as well as the abundance of light elements created buring BBN. These quantities in turn affect the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy. We present the first joint analysis of small-scale temperature and polarization CMB anisotropy from Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and South Pole Telescope (SPT), together with Planck data and the recent primordial abundance measurements of helium and deuterium to place comprehensive bounds on the mass of light thermal-relic dark matter.

- name: Testing a quintessence model with Yukawa interaction from cosmological observations and N-body simulations
  arxiv: 1809.03224
  desc: We consider a quintessence model with Yukawa interaction between dark energy and dark matter and constrain this model by employing the recent cosmological data. We find that an interaction in the dark sector is compatible with observations. The Yukawa interaction model is found to be moderately favored by Planck and able to alleviate the discordance between weak lensing measurements and CMB measurements as previously inferred from the standard Lambda cold dark matter model. N-body simulations for Yukawa interaction model is also performed. We find that using the halo density profile is plausible to improve the constraints significantly in the future.

- name: Relieving the Tension between Weak Lensing and Cosmic Microwave Background with Interacting Dark Matter and Dark Energy Models
  arxiv: 1711.06799
  desc: We constrain interacting dark matter and dark energy (IDMDE) models using a 450-degree-square cosmic shear data from the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) and the angular power spectra from Planck's latest cosmic microwave background measurements. We revisit the discordance problem in the standard Lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model between weak lensing and Planck datasets and extend the discussion by introducing interacting dark sectors. The IDMDE models are found to be able to alleviate the discordance between KiDS and Planck as previously inferred from the ΛCDM model, and moderately favored by a combination of the two datasets.
