- name: Reconstructing the early-universe expansion and thermal history
  arxiv: 2310.17195
  desc: We present a model-independent reconstruction of the early expansion and thermal histories of the universe, obtained from light element abundance measurements. The expansion history is tightly constrained around the onset of the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). The temperature of photons is additionally constrained around the time of neutrino decoupling. We introduce a new and general analytic fitting formula for the temperature variation, which is flexible enough to reproduce the signal of large classes of beyond-CDM particle models that can alter the temperature through early-time energy injection. We present its constraints from BBN data and from the measurements of effective number of relativistic species and helium-4 abundance probed by the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation anisotropy. Our results provide clarity on the most fundamental properties of the early universe, reconstructed with minimal assumptions about the unknown physics that can occur at keV--MeV energy scales and can be mapped to broad classes of models of interest to cosmology.

- name: Self-Interacting Neutrinos in Light of Large-Scale Structure Data
  arxiv: 2309.03956
  desc: We explore a self-interacting neutrino cosmology in which neutrinos experience a delayed onset of free streaming. Using the effective field theory of large-scale structure (LSS), we perform the first combined likelihood analysis of BOSS full-shape galaxy clustering, weak lensing, and Lyman-alpha forest measurements, together with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropy data from Planck, in search for evidence of neutrino self-interactions. In agreement with previous results, we find a bimodal posterior distribution for the effective strength of neutrino self-interaction, showing that a vanishingly small interaction and a relatively strong interaction are both consistent with cosmological data, providing fits of nearly equal quality. We find that strong self-interactions in the neutrino sector can alleviate the H0 tension while maintaining a good fit to the LSS data. Our results may have implications for particle model-building and ongoing neutrino oscillation experiments, and motivate further exploration of particle interactions that can generate a delay in neutrino free-streaming.

- name: Can Neutrino Self-interactions Save Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter?
  arxiv: 2301.08299
  desc: Sterile neutrinos produced through self-interactions of active neutrinos have received attention as a particle candidate that can yield the entire observed DM relic abundance without violating the most stringent constraints from X-ray observations. We examine consistency of this production mechanism with the abundance of small-scale structure in the universe, as captured by the population of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way.

- name: S8 Tension in the Context of Dark Matter-Baryon Scattering
  arxiv: 2301.08260
  desc: We explore an interacting dark matter (IDM) model that allows for a fraction of dark matter (DM) to undergo velocity-independent scattering with baryons. In this scenario, structure on small scales is suppressed relative to the cold DM scenario. Using the effective field theory of large-scale structure, we perform the first systematic analysis of BOSS full-shape galaxy clustering data for the IDM scenario, and we find that this model alleviates the S8 tension between large-scale structure and Planck data. Adding the S8 prior from DES to our analysis further leads to a mild ∼3σ preference for a non-vanishing DM-baryon scattering cross-section, assuming ∼10% of DM is interacting and has a particle mass of 1 MeV. This result produces a modest ∼20% suppression of the linear power at k≲1 h/Mpc, consistent with other small-scale structure observations. Similar scale-dependent power suppression was previously shown to have the potential to resolve S8 tension between cosmological data sets. The validity of the specific IDM model explored here will be critically tested with upcoming galaxy surveys at the interaction level needed to alleviate the S8 tension.

- name: What does cosmology tell us about the mass of thermal-relic dark matter?
  arxiv: 2202.03515
  desc: The presence of light thermally coupled dark matter affects early expansion history and production of light elements during the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Specifically, dark matter that annihilates into Standard Model particles can modify the effective number of light species in the universe Neff, as well as the abundance of light elements created buring BBN. These quantities in turn affect the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy. We present the first joint analysis of small-scale temperature and polarization CMB anisotropy from Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and South Pole Telescope (SPT), together with Planck data and the recent primordial abundance measurements of helium and deuterium to place comprehensive bounds on the mass of light thermal-relic dark matter.

- name: Testing a quintessence model with Yukawa interaction from cosmological observations and N-body simulations
  arxiv: 1809.03224
  desc: We consider a quintessence model with Yukawa interaction between dark energy and dark matter and constrain this model by employing the recent cosmological data. We find that an interaction in the dark sector is compatible with observations. The Yukawa interaction model is found to be moderately favored by Planck and able to alleviate the discordance between weak lensing measurements and CMB measurements as previously inferred from the standard Lambda cold dark matter model. N-body simulations for Yukawa interaction model is also performed. We find that using the halo density profile is plausible to improve the constraints significantly in the future.

- name: The first constraint from SDSS galaxy-galaxy weak lensing measurements on interacting dark energy models
  arxiv: 1807.05522
  desc: We combine constraints from linear and nonlinear scales, for the first time, to study the interaction between dark matter and dark energy. We devise a novel N-body simulation pipeline for cosmological models beyond ΛCDM. This pipeline is fully self-consistent and opens a new window to study the nonlinear structure formation in general phenomenological interacting dark energy models. By comparing our simulation results with the SDSS galaxy-galaxy weak lensing measurements, we are able to constrain the strength of interaction between dark energy and dark matter. Compared with the previous studies using linear examinations, we point to plausible improvements on the constraints of interaction strength by using small scale information from weak lensing. This improvement is mostly due to the sensitivity of weak lensing measurements on nonlinear structure formation at low redshift. With this new pipeline, it is possible to look for smoking gun signatures of dark matter-dark energy interaction.

- name: A Fully Self-Consistent Cosmological Simulation Pipeline for Interacting Dark Energy Models
  arxiv: 1811.01519
  desc: We devise a fully self-consistent simulation pipeline for the first time to study the interaction between dark matter and dark energy. We perform convergence tests and show that our code is accurate on different scales. Using the parameters constrained by Planck, Type Ia Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Hubble constant observations, we perform cosmological N-body simulations. We calculate the resulting matter power spectra and halo mass functions for four different interacting dark energy models. In addition to the dark matter density distribution, we also show the inhomogeneous density distribution of dark energy. With this new simulation pipeline, we can further refine and constrain interacting dark energy models.

- name: Relieving the Tension between Weak Lensing and Cosmic Microwave Background with Interacting Dark Matter and Dark Energy Models
  arxiv: 1711.06799
  desc: We constrain interacting dark matter and dark energy (IDMDE) models using a 450-degree-square cosmic shear data from the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) and the angular power spectra from Planck's latest cosmic microwave background measurements. We revisit the discordance problem in the standard Lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model between weak lensing and Planck datasets and extend the discussion by introducing interacting dark sectors. The IDMDE models are found to be able to alleviate the discordance between KiDS and Planck as previously inferred from the ΛCDM model, and moderately favored by a combination of the two datasets.

- name: Dynamical analysis of modified gravity with nonminimal gravitational coupling to matter
  arxiv: 1512.09281
  desc: We perform a phase space analysis of a generalized modified gravity theory with nonminimally coupling between geometry and matter. We apply the dynamical system approach to this generalized model and find that in the cosmological context, different choices of Lagrangian density will apparently result in different phases of the Universe. By carefully choosing the variables, we prove that there is an attractor solution to describe the late time accelerating universe when the modified gravity is chosen in a simple power-law form of the curvature scalar. We further examine the temperature evolution based on the thermodynamic understanding of the model. Confronting the model with supernova type Ia data sets, we find that the nonminimally coupled theory of gravity is a viable model to describe the late time Universe acceleration.
